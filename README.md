Analog Thermometer
===================

A small, simple, low power circuit that turns practically any analog ammeter into an attractive temerature display.

  * One inch square PCB size
  * Low cost (single quantity [components](./blob/master/digikey_bom.csv): $7, OSHPark PCB: $5)
  * Runs from a single 2.5-5.5V supply, current consumption <15uA (plus analog meter current requirements)
  * [Easily adapted](./blob/master/CONSTRUCTION.md) to work with nearly any ammeter by changing a single resistor, and/or by adjusting a potentiometer
