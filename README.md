Analog Thermometer
===================

A small, simple, low power circuit that turns practically any analog ammeter into an attractive temerature display.

  * One inch square PCB size
  * Low cost (single quatntitcy components: $7, OSHPark PCB: $5)
  * Runs from a single 2.5-5.5V supply, typical current consumption <15uA (plus analog meter current requirements)
  * Easily adapted to work with nearly any ammeter with a single resistor, or by adjusting a potentiometer
